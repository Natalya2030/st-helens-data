The Mersey Forest is a growing network of trees and woodlands covering 1,370 km2  of Merseyside and North Cheshire, which is home to 1.7 million people.\n- Mersey Forest Plan 9m trees planted since 1991 \n- Achieved three times more tree planting than the England average\n- Created over 3,000 hectares of woodland. That's the same as 4,322 full-sized football  pitches, or 24,000 Olympic swimming pools\n- Absorbed 524,574 tonnes of carbon dioxide, which demonstrates a clear impact on climate change.  \n\n**Case Study** - Bold Forest Park\n\nA cluster of community woodlands spanning 220 hectares,  including Sutton Manor, Clock Face Country Park and Griffin Wood, has dramatically  improved the image of the area and offers a future source of economic development.\n\n[Source: Mersey Forest Delivery Plan PDF](https://www.merseyforest.org.uk/mersey_forest_delivery_plan_final.pdf)","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"SDG_INDICATOR_INFO__GLOBAL":"","SDG_GOAL__GLOBAL":"Goal 15: Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss","SDG_TARGET__GLOBAL":"Target 15.2: By 2020, promote the implementation of sustainable management of all types of forests, halt deforestation, restore degraded forests and substantially increase afforestation and reforestation globally","SDG_INDICATOR__GLOBAL":"Indicator 15.2.1: Progress towards sustainable forest management","SDG_SERIES_DESCR__GLOBAL":"","META_LAST_UPDATE__GLOBAL":"","SDG_RELATED_INDICATORS__GLOBAL":"","SDG_CUSTODIAN_AGENCIES__GLOBAL":"Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)","CONTACT__GLOBAL":"","CONTACT_ORGANISATION__GLOBAL":"","CONTACT_NAME__GLOBAL":"","ORGANISATION_UNIT__GLOBAL":"","CONTACT_FUNCT__GLOBAL":"","CONTACT_PHONE__GLOBAL":"","CONTACT_MAIL__GLOBAL":"","CONTACT_EMAIL__GLOBAL":"","IND_DEF_CON_CLASS__GLOBAL":"","STAT_CONC_DEF__GLOBAL":"","UNIT_MEASURE__GLOBAL":"","CLASS_SYSTEM__GLOBAL":"","SRC_TYPE_COLL_METHOD__GLOBAL":"","SOURCE_TYPE__GLOBAL":"","COLL_METHOD__GLOBAL":"","FREQ_COLL__GLOBAL":"","REL_CAL_POLICY__GLOBAL":"","DATA_SOURCE__GLOBAL":"","COMPILING_ORG__GLOBAL":"","INST_MANDATE__GLOBAL":"","OTHER_METHOD__GLOBAL":"","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"Data follows the UN specification for this indicator.
