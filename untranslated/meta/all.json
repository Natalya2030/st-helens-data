p.4). \n\nThe World Health Organisation defines the four types of female genital mutilation as follows - \n\nType 1 - Partial or total removal of the clitoral glans (the external and visible part of the clitoris, which is a sensitive part of the female genitals, with the function of providing sexual pleasure to the woman), and/or the prepuce/clitoral hood (the fold of skin surrounding the clitoral glans). \n\nType 2 - Partial or total removal of the clitoral glans and the labia minora (the inner folds of the vulva), with or without removal of the labia majora (the outer folds of skin of the vulva). \n\nType 3 - (Often referred to as infibulation). Narrowing of the vaginal opening with the creation of a covering seal. The seal is formed by cutting and repositioning the labia minora, or labia majora. The covering of the vaginal opening is done with or without removal of the clitoral prepuce/clitoral hood and glans (Type I FGM). \n\nType 4 - All other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes, for example pricking, piercing, incising, scraping and cauterization.","UNIT_MEASURE":"Number of individuals","CLASS_SYSTEM":"","SRC_TYPE_COLL_METHOD":"","SOURCE_TYPE":"[Female Genital Mutilation](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/female-genital-mutilation#past-publications)","COLL_METHOD":"","FREQ_COLL":"","REL_CAL_POLICY":"","DATA_SOURCE":"","COMPILING_ORG":"National Health Service (NHS)","INST_MANDATE":"","OTHER_METHOD":"","RATIONALE":"","REC_USE_LIM":"Values between 1-7 are rounded to 5.

short reference period (one week), were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit.\n\n**Poverty Line:** Threshold below which individuals in the reference population are considered poor and above which they are considered non-poor. The threshold is generally defined as the per-capita monetary requirements an individual needs to afford the purchase of a basic bundle of goods and services. For the purpose of this indicator, an absolute international poverty line of US$1.90 per day is used.\n\n**Household in poverty:** Households are defined as poor if their income or consumption expenditure is below the poverty line taking into account the number of household members and composition (e.g., number of adults and children).\n\n**Working poor:** Employed persons living in households that are classified as poor, that is, that have income or consumption levels below the poverty line used for

the public or private sector according to their responses to the survey. Consequently, the classification of an individuals sector may differ from how they would be classified in QPSES statistics. \n\nOfficial estimates of public sector employment compiled from QPSES are generally lower than estimates available from APS. This is partially because many people who work within public sector premises, whilst being employed by private sector organizations, will classify themselves as working in the public sector, e.g. cleaners or security guards employed by a contractor to work at public sector premises.
